# Multi-Timeframe Backtest - Interim Observations

**Date**: 2025-10-16 21:03 KST
**Status**: 3-month test 60% complete (588/980 bars)

## Current Progress

| Timeframe | Weight | Status | Current Return | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------------|-------|
| 1 month | 40% | ‚úÖ Complete | **+3.16%** | 280 trades, 30.36% win rate |
| 3 months | 30% | üîÑ 60% done | **-5.33%** (est.) | Balance: $9,467 / $10,000 |
| 6 months | 20% | ‚è≥ Queued | TBD | - |
| 12 months | 10% | ‚è≥ Queued | TBD | - |

## Early Warning Signs

### üö® Potential Overfitting Detected

**Evidence**:
1. **1-month**: +3.16% (profitable, good signal distribution)
2. **3-month (60% complete)**: -5.33% (losing, same parameters)

**Interpretation**:
- v4.0 parameters appear optimized for **recent market conditions**
- Performance degrades when tested on slightly older data
- Classic sign of overfitting to recent price action

### XPL Hard Stops

From the log, multiple XPL positions hitting hard stops with significant losses:
```
XPL/USDT_SHORT @ $1.32 | P&L: $-56.47 (-6.41%)
XPL/USDT_LONG @ $1.42 | P&L: $-40.33 (-4.21%)
XPL/USDT_LONG @ $1.39 | P&L: $-74.63 (-7.74%)
```

**Observation**: XPL showing higher volatility and larger losses than expected. The 2.8% hard stop might be insufficient for XPL's actual volatility during the 3-month period.

## Preliminary Hypothesis

### Why 1-month Works, 3-month Doesn't

**Market Regime Change**:
- Recent 1-month: Volatility patterns match our compression/expansion thresholds
- Older 2-3 months: Different volatility regime, thresholds misaligned

**Possible Causes**:
1. **ATR Thresholds Too Tight**: Parameters calibrated on recent data with specific volatility characteristics
2. **BB Compression Too Specific**: Bollinger Band thresholds optimized for recent consolidation patterns
3. **Hard Stops Inadequate**: 1.5-2.8% stops work recently, but insufficient for earlier volatility
4. **Market Conditions**: Crypto market volatility changed significantly over 3-month period

## Potential Solutions (Pending Full Results)

### Option 1: Dynamic Parameter Adjustment
- Use **adaptive ATR** thresholds based on recent volatility
- Adjust BB compression thresholds based on historical bandwidth averages
- **Dynamic hard stops** scaled to current ATR (already recommended)

### Option 2: Parameter Re-calibration
- Re-tune using **3-month** or **6-month** data instead of 1-month
- Find parameters that work across multiple market regimes
- Accept lower signal frequency for better robustness

### Option 3: Regime Detection
- Add **market regime classification** (high/low volatility, trending/ranging)
- Use different parameter sets for different regimes
- More complex but potentially more robust

### Option 4: ML Integration
- Activate the existing **ML engine** (currently unused)
- Use ML to predict optimal parameters based on current market conditions
- Combine technical signals with ML-based regime detection

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Wait for Completion)
1. ‚è≥ Complete 3-month, 6-month, 12-month backtests
2. ‚è≥ Calculate weighted composite metrics
3. ‚è≥ Analyze full performance breakdown

### Short-term (After Results Available)
1. üîç **Analyze period-by-period performance**
   - Identify specific dates/periods where strategy fails
   - Correlate with market volatility metrics
   - Understand regime differences

2. üîß **Implement Critical Improvements** (from v4 summary):
   - **Volume Filter** (highest priority, expected +5% win rate)
   - **Dynamic Hard Stops** (prevent XPL-style large losses)
   - Consider signal strength-based position sizing

3. üß™ **Test v5.0 with Improvements**
   - Run same multi-timeframe validation
   - Compare robustness across periods
   - Verify improvements work in all regimes

### Strategic Decision Tree

```
IF multi-timeframe results show:
  ‚îú‚îÄ All periods profitable (unlikely based on 3m interim):
  ‚îÇ   ‚Üí Proceed with v5.0 improvements (volume, dynamic stops)
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ 1m profitable, others negative (likely scenario):
  ‚îÇ   ‚Üí **Re-calibrate** using 3-month or 6-month data
  ‚îÇ   ‚Üí Implement **regime detection** or **adaptive parameters**
  ‚îÇ   ‚Üí Test v5.0 across all periods again
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ All periods negative:
      ‚Üí **Fundamental strategy review** required
      ‚Üí Consider ML integration as primary (not supplementary)
      ‚Üí Possibly re-think two-way entry conditions
```

## Technical Observations

### Trade Execution Quality
From the logs, the strategy is executing properly:
- ‚úÖ Two-way entries working (LONG+SHORT simultaneous)
- ‚úÖ Trailing stops activating and closing profitable positions
- ‚úÖ Hard stops protecting against runaway losses
- ‚úÖ Position sizing consistent across coins

**No execution issues** - the problem is **parameter selection**, not implementation.

### Coin Performance Patterns
Need to analyze per-coin breakdown once 3-month completes:
- Which coins contribute to losses?
- Is XPL still problematic (was 15% in 1-month)?
- Are low-ATR coins (BTC, ETH) performing differently?

## Confidence Assessment

**Current Confidence in v4.0**:
- **1-month forward testing**: Medium-High (proven profitable)
- **3-month robustness**: Low (showing losses)
- **Production readiness**: Low (needs multi-timeframe stability)

**Expected Outcome**:
- Weighted composite return: **Likely negative** (1m positive outweighed by 3m+ negative)
- Validation status: **Likely FAIL** (won't pass 6/7 validation checks)
- Next action: **Parameter re-calibration required** before production

## Conclusion (Preliminary)

The multi-timeframe backtest is **performing exactly as intended** - it's exposing potential overfitting that wasn't visible in the 1-month validation. This is a **GOOD THING** because it prevents deploying a strategy that would fail in production.

**Key Insight**: v4.0 signal strength fix was **directionally correct** (all coins now generate signals), but the **parameter values themselves** may be overfit to recent market conditions.

**Recommended Path Forward** (after full results):
1. Wait for complete multi-timeframe results (2-3 hours)
2. Analyze which periods and coins drive losses
3. Re-calibrate parameters using 3-month or 6-month data
4. Implement volume filter + dynamic hard stops
5. Run multi-timeframe validation on v5.0
6. Only proceed to production if ALL timeframes show stability
