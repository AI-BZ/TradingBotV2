# v5.0 Multi-Timeframe Validation - Monitoring

**Start Time**: 2025-10-17 00:01:53 KST
**Status**: Running
**Expected Duration**: 2-3 hours

## Test Configuration

### v5.0 Features Being Tested
- ✅ **Dynamic Hard Stop**: ATR-based adaptive stops (`max(1%, ATR% × 2.0)`)
- ❌ **Volume Filter**: Disabled (avg_volume not implemented)

### Timeframes and Weights
| Timeframe | Period | Weight | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|
| 1 month | 2025-09-16 to 2025-10-16 | 40% | Recent adaptation |
| 3 months | 2025-07-16 to 2025-10-16 | 30% | Quarterly stability |
| 6 months | 2025-04-16 to 2025-10-16 | 20% | Extended robustness |
| 12 months | 2024-10-16 to 2025-10-16 | 10% | Full cycle validation |

## Hypothesis

**Problem**: v4.0 showed potential overfitting
- 1-month: +3.16% ✅ (profitable)
- 3-month (60% complete): -5.3% ❌ (losing)

**Expected with v5.0 Dynamic Hard Stops**:
1. 3-month result should improve significantly over v4.0's -5.3%
2. More consistent performance across all timeframes
3. Reduced volatility in win rates across periods
4. Better risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)

## v4.0 Baseline for Comparison

| Metric | 1-Month | 3-Month (partial) |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Total Return | +3.16% | -5.3% |
| Win Rate | 30.36% | Unknown |
| Total Trades | 280 | Unknown |
| Profit Factor | 1.09 | Unknown |
| Max Drawdown | 16.37% | Unknown |

## v5.0 1-Month Result (Reference)

From previous v5_validation_summary.md:
- Total Return: +3.30% (+0.14% vs v4.0)
- Win Rate: **37.92%** (+7.56% vs v4.0)
- Total Trades: 240 (-40 vs v4.0, more selective)
- Profit Factor: 1.09 (maintained)
- Max Drawdown: 17.50% (+1.13% vs v4.0)
- **Validation**: PASSED 6/7 checks

## Critical Success Factors

### Must Pass (Critical)
1. **3-month improvement**: Return > -5.3% (v4.0 baseline)
2. **Weighted return positive**: Composite score > 0%
3. **Reduced overfitting**: ≥50% of timeframes profitable

### Should Pass (Important)
4. **Weighted win rate > 35%**: Maintain high win rate
5. **All timeframes active**: All 10 coins trading in each period
6. **Consistent profit factor**: >1.0 across most timeframes
7. **Win rate consistency**: Std dev <10% across timeframes

## Expected Timeline

- **00:01:53 - 00:08:00** (6 min): 1-month test ✅ Started
- **00:08:00 - 00:26:00** (18 min): 3-month test 🔄 Pending
- **00:26:00 - 01:02:00** (36 min): 6-month test 🔄 Pending
- **01:02:00 - 02:14:00** (72 min): 12-month test 🔄 Pending
- **02:14:00 - 02:16:00** (2 min): Final analysis 🔄 Pending

**Total Expected**: ~2 hours 14 minutes

## Progress Tracking

### 1-Month Test
- **Status**: Running (loading data)
- **Progress**: Data loading for BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT
- **Expected Result**: Should match previous +3.30% result

### 3-Month Test
- **Status**: Pending
- **Critical**: This is the key test for overfitting validation
- **Target**: >-5.3% (must beat v4.0)

### 6-Month Test
- **Status**: Pending
- **Purpose**: Extended robustness check

### 12-Month Test
- **Status**: Pending
- **Purpose**: Full market cycle validation

## Monitoring Commands

Check progress:
```bash
cd /Users/gyejinpark/Documents/GitHub/TradingBotV2/backend
tail -f v5_multi_timeframe_output.log | grep -E "TIMEFRAME|Results:|Return:|Win Rate:|validation"
```

Check if complete:
```bash
grep "MULTI-TIMEFRAME VALIDATION PASSED\|PARTIAL SUCCESS\|NEEDS IMPROVEMENT" v5_multi_timeframe_output.log
```

## Next Steps After Completion

### If PASSED (≥6/7 checks)
1. Document success in comprehensive summary
2. Compare detailed metrics with v4.0
3. Proceed with volume filter implementation (requires avg_volume)
4. Consider production deployment

### If PARTIAL (4-5/7 checks)
1. Analyze which timeframes failed
2. Identify specific parameter adjustments needed
3. Consider fine-tuning hard_stop_atr_multiplier (currently 2.0)
4. May need additional improvements beyond dynamic stops

### If FAILED (<4/7 checks)
1. Deep dive into failure modes
2. Reconsider dynamic hard stop approach
3. Explore alternative exit strategies
4. May need fundamental strategy revision

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dynamic Hard Stop Logic
Located in `trailing_stop_manager.py:153-171`:

```python
if self.use_dynamic_hard_stop:
    # Dynamic: ATR-based adaptive stops
    atr_pct = atr_value / current_price
    dynamic_stop_distance = max(self.max_loss_pct, atr_pct * self.hard_stop_atr_multiplier)

    # Check if loss exceeds dynamic stop
    if current_profit_pct < -dynamic_stop_distance:
        hard_stop_hit = True
        logger.warning(f"DYNAMIC HARD STOP HIT! Loss {current_profit_pct:.2%} exceeds {-dynamic_stop_distance:.2%}")
```

**Key Features**:
- Minimum 1% stop (never tighter than fixed)
- Scales with ATR × 2.0 multiplier
- High volatility → wider stops (e.g., XPL with 4% ATR → 8% stop)
- Low volatility → tighter stops (e.g., BTC with 0.7% ATR → 1.4% stop)

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Areas**:
- 1-month should match previous +3.30% (already validated)
- Dynamic stop implementation is solid and tested
- All 10 coins should remain active

**Medium Risk Areas**:
- 3-month may still be negative (market conditions)
- Longer timeframes untested with this strategy
- Win rate consistency across periods

**High Risk Areas**:
- Dynamic stops alone may not solve overfitting completely
- Volume filter still missing (could help further)
- Strategy may be fundamentally sensitive to market regime
