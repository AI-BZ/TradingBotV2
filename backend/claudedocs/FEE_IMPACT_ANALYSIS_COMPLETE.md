# Complete Fee Impact Analysis and Strategy Comparison
## High-Frequency vs Selective Trading

**Analysis Date**: 2025-10-17
**Test Period**: 2024-10-02 to 2024-10-09 (7 days)
**Symbol**: ETH/USDT
**Data**: 110,000+ ticks

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive analysis was performed to understand the impact of trading fees and slippage on backtesting results, and to compare two distinct trading strategies:

- **Strategy A (High-Frequency)**: Current approach with 5,666 trades over 7 days
- **Strategy B (Selective High-Confidence)**: Top 20% trades only (1,133 trades)

**Key Finding**: Strategy B outperforms Strategy A by $10,230 (+8.43%) despite executing 80% fewer trades, primarily due to massive fee savings of $33,694 (81.6% reduction).

---

## Background: Fee Discovery

### Initial Problem
User asked: "현재 수익계산에 수수료도 포함한거야?" (Are fees included in the current profit calculations?)

### Investigation Results
**Original Backtest** (without fees):
- Total Return: +1,526%
- Total Profit: $152,617
- No fee calculation in code

**With Fees Applied** (0.05% taker + 0.01% slippage):
- Total Return: +1,182% (-344%)
- Total Profit: $118,223 (-$34,394)
- Fees consumed: 22.54% of gross profits

### Fee Calculation Formula
```python
# Per trade (entry + exit):
position_value = entry_price × size
entry_fee = position_value × 0.0005  # 0.05% taker
exit_fee = position_value × 0.0005   # 0.05% taker
slippage = position_value × 0.0002   # 0.02% round-trip
total_cost = 0.12% of position value
```

**Average Fee Per Trade**: $6.07
**Total Fees (5,666 trades)**: $34,394

- **Savings**: $33,694 (81.6% reduction)
- **Conclusion**: Fee management is as important as trading strategy

### 2. Quality Over Quantity
- **20% of trades** generate **84.6% of total profit**
- **80% of trades** generate only **15.4% of total profit**
- **Average profit**: Top 20% = $107/trade vs Bottom 80% = $4/trade
- **Conclusion**: Most trades are noise, a few drive performance

### 3. Efficiency Multiplier
- Strategy B is **5.46x more efficient** per trade
- Each Strategy B trade = **5.46 Strategy A trades** in value
- **Trade reduction**: 80% fewer trades for similar gross profit

## Risk Assessment

### Strategy A Risks
- ⚠️ **High Fee Burden**: 27% of profits consumed
- ⚠️ **Low Win Rate**: 42% (barely break-even quality)

    entry_with_slippage = entry_price * (1 + self.slippage_pct)
    exit_with_slippage = exit_price * (1 - self.slippage_pct)
    pnl_gross = (exit_with_slippage - entry_with_slippage) * size * self.leverage
else:  # SHORT
    entry_with_slippage = entry_price * (1 - self.slippage_pct)
    exit_with_slippage = exit_price * (1 + self.slippage_pct)
    pnl_gross = (entry_with_slippage - exit_with_slippage) * size * self.leverage

# Calculate fees
position_value = entry_price * size
entry_fee = position_value * self.taker_fee
exit_fee = position_value * self.taker_fee
total_fee = entry_fee + exit_fee

# Net P&L
pnl_net = pnl_gross - total_fee
```
